Japanese confection
 Akumaki
Akumaki (あくまき, 灰汁巻き) is a Japanese-style confection, or wagashi made in Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Kumamoto Prefecture during the Boys’ Festival on May 5.[1][2] It is called more widely chimaki in Japan, and come from Chinese zongzi, that is eaten for the double 5 festival.[3]

How it is made[edit]
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
A skin of bamboo soaked in lye overnight is used to wrap glutinous rice soaked in the same way. Because it's slightly bitter, so it's typically eaten with blended sugar and toasted soybean flour (kinako), with a little salt or soaked in honey. It has an unusual flavor and is considered an acquired taste.
It is said that akumaki began as a long-term provision for samurai during the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) or the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). Also, Saigō Takamori (1821–1877) took akumaki as a nonperishable commodity to the battlefield during the Satsuma Rebellion (1877). Akumaki became popular in the north of Miyazaki Prefecture and Kumamoto Prefecture due to that rebellion.
It can be kept for about one week at normal temperature, for about two weeks in a refrigerator and it can also be frozen. Vacuum-packed akumaki can be found in many places as a souvenir, but it is usually a homemade confection. Recently, since the opening of the Kyushu Shinkansen train line, akumaki has attracted considerable attention as a slow food. Akumaki is sold in hotels of Kagoshima, roadside stations (michi no eki), over the internet and in supermarkets throughout Kagoshima prefecture.

Japanese traditional confectionery
AmanattōPeanut amanattōTypeConfectioneryPlace of originJapanRegion or stateEast AsiaCreated byHosoda YasubeiMain ingredientsAdzuki or other beans, sugar, sugar syrup
Amanattō (甘納豆) is a Japanese traditional confectionery made of azuki or other beans, covered with refined sugar after simmering with sugar syrup and drying.[1]
It was developed by Hosoda Yasubei during the Bunkyū years (1861–1863) in the Edo period. He opened a wagashi store in Tokyo, which he named for his childhood name: Eitaro. This store continues to operate.[2]
Amanattō was originally called amananattō (甘名納糖); the name was abbreviated to amanattō after World War II. The resemblance of the name to the fermented bean dish nattō is coincidental.[citation needed]
In Hokkaidō, amanattō is used in cooking sekihan. For this reason, unlike other areas in East Asia, the sekihan of Hokkaidō is a little sweet.[citation needed]

Japanese cracker
ArareHina-arare, a variety of arareTypeRice crackerPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsGlutinous rice, soy sauceVariationsOlive no Hana  Media: ArareArare (あられ, which is named after graupel ""snow pellets"") is a type of bite-sized Japanese cracker made from glutinous rice and flavored with soy sauce. The size and shapes are what distinguish arare from senbei. The name is chosen to evoke hailstones – smaller arare are similar in size and shape to hailstones, though others can vary significantly in size, flavor and shape. Arare is also called kakimochi or mochi crunch in Hawaii where it was introduced in the 1900s.

Types[edit]
There are many different sizes, colors, and shapes of arare.  Some are sweet, and others savory. One, called norimaki arare (nori meaning an edible seaweed in the form of a dried sheet; maki meaning roll shape) is wrapped with dried nori seaweed. Another, kaki no tane (柿の種), takes its name from its resemblance to a persimmon seed. (Kaki is Japanese for ""persimmon"".) Kaki no tane are often sold with peanuts, a combination called kakipī (かきピー).[1] These are a popular snack to accompany Japanese beer.

Culture[edit]
Japanese typically consume arare to celebrate Hinamatsuri, the ""doll festival"" held on 3 March. The arare made during the festival are multicolored, in shades including pink, yellow, white, brown and light green.[2] Regular arare can be bought throughout the year, but the colorful ones are only available around January to March in anticipation of Hinamatsuri.
Arare was brought to the U.S. by Japanese immigrants who came as plantation workers in the early 1900s. In Hawaii, the snack is often called kakimochi (fried rice paste).[3] In Hawaii, it is popular to mix arare with popcorn (some people mix in furikake, too). The popular ""Hurricane popcorn"" includes both arare and furikake with the popcorn.

BotamochiTypeConfectionery, Rice cakePlace of originJapanMain ingredientsglutinous rice, rice, sweet red bean pasteVariationsOhagi  Media: Botamochi
Botamochi (ぼたもち or 牡丹餅) is a wagashi (Japanese confection) made with glutinous rice, regular rice (ratio of 7:3, or only glutinous rice), and sweet azuki paste (red bean paste). They are made by soaking the rice for approximately 1 hour. The rice is then cooked, and a thick azuki paste is hand-packed around pre-formed balls of rice. Botamochi is eaten as sacred food as offering during the weeks of the spring and the autumn Higan in Japan.
Another name for this kind of confection is ohagi (おはぎ), which the origin and the definition of is in argument but some people say [1] uses a slightly different texture of azuki paste but is otherwise almost identical, it is made in autumn and some recipe variations in both cases call for a coating of soy flour to be applied to the ohagi after the azuki paste.

 Botamochi (Koshian type, which is smooth and fine-grained red bean paste type）
The two different names are, some people say,[2] derived from the Botan (peony) which blooms in the spring and the Hagi (Japanese bush clover or Lespedeza) which blooms during autumn.
Botamochi is the modern name for the dish kaimochi (かいもち) mentioned in the Heian Period text Uji Shūi Monogatari (宇治拾遺物語).[citation needed]
The proverb Tana kara botamochi (棚からぼたもち), literally ""a botamochi falls down from a shelf"", means ""receiving a windfall"", ""a lucky break"".
The term is also used for a specific pattern of Bizen ware with two, three or five round marks, as if the marks of the small balls of rice cakes were left on the plate.[3][4]

DaifukuAlternative namesDaifukumochi (Kōhaku type)Place of originJapanRegion or stateEast AsiaMain ingredientsglutinous rice, sweet filling (usually red bean paste)VariationsYomogi daifuku, Ichigo daifuku, Yukimi Daifuku Cookbook: Daifuku  Media: Daifuku
Daifukumochi (大福餅), or daifuku (大福) (literally ""great luck""), is a wagashi, (a type of Japanese confection) consisting of a small round mochi (a glutinous rice cake) stuffed with a sweet filling, most commonly anko, (a sweetened red bean paste made from azuki beans). Daifuku is a popular wagashi in Japan and is often served with green tea.

 Daifuku (plain type)
Daifuku comes in many varieties. The most common are white, pale green, or pale pink-colored mochi filled with anko. Daifuku are approximately 4 cm (1.5 in) in diameter. Nearly all daifuku are covered in a fine layer of rice flour (rice starch), corn starch, or potato starch to keep them from sticking to each other or to the fingers. Though mochitsuki is the traditional method of making mochi and daifuku, they can also be cooked in the microwave.[1]

Daifuku was originally called Habutai mochi (腹太餅) (belly thick rice cake) because of its filling's nature. Later, the name was changed to daifuku mochi (大腹餅) (big belly rice cake). Since the pronunciations of Fuku (腹) (belly) and Fuku (福) (luck) are the same in Japanese, the name was further changed to daifuku mochi (大福餅) (great luck rice cake), a bringer of good luck. By the end of the 18th century, daifuku were gaining popularity, and people began eating them toasted. They were also used for gifts in ceremonial occasions.[2]

Types[edit]
The many different varieties of dango are usually named after the various seasonings served on or with it.[2]

Popular dango[edit]
Anko dango (あんこ団子) is commonly covered with sweetened red bean paste; ingredients other than azuki are used on rare occasions. Other toppings for anko include zunda (ずんだ) made from edamame paste and kurumi (walnut) paste.
Cha dango (茶団子) is green tea (matcha) flavored dango.[3]
Shoyu dango (醤油だんご) is a kind of baked dango (yaki dango (焼き団子)), and is seasoned with soy sauce. Furthermore, the one wrapped with nori is called isobe dango (磯辺団子).
Goma dango (ごま団子) is covered with sesame paste. It is both sweet and salty.
Hanami dango (花見だんご) is sanshoku dango (三色団子) to eat during hanami. It has three colors (pink, green, white), and is traditionally made during sakura-viewing season, hence the name (hanami means ""flower viewing""; hana meaning ""flower"", and mi meaning ""to see""). The order of the three colored dumplings is said to represent the order in which cherry blossoms bloom. Pink represents cherry buds, white represents cherry blossoms in full bloom, and green represents leafy cherry blossoms after they have fallen.
Kibi dango (きび団子) is made with millet flour. This variety is prominently featured in the tale of Momotarō, a folkloric Japanese hero, who offers the rounded ball (not skewered) to three talking animals in exchange for their aid in fighting demons.
Kinako dango (きなこ団子) is made with toasted soy flour.
Kusa dango or yomogi dango (草団子 or よもぎ団子) is mixed leaves of yomogi, like kusa mochi. It is often covered with anko.
Mitarashi (みたらし団子) is covered with a syrup made from shouyu (soy sauce), sugar, and starch.
Sasa dango (笹団子) is produced and eaten primarily in Niigata Prefecture. Sasa dango has two varieties: onna dango and otoko dango. Onna dango (literally ""female dango"") is filled with anko, while the otoko dango (literally ""male dango"") is filled with kinpira. The dango is wrapped in leaves of sasa for the purpose of preservation.
Shiratama dango (白玉だんご) is eaten in anmitsu or mitsumame.
Tsukimi dango (月見だんご) is white dango to eat during Tsukimi. It is traditionally made during autumn full moon (Mid-Autumn Festival).
Various other dango[edit]
Botchan dango (坊っちゃん団子) has three colors.  One is colored by red beans, the second by eggs, and the third by green tea. Botchan dango is a product name of Ehime’s miyagegashi, which was named after Natsume Sōseki’s novel Botchan.
Chichi dango (乳団子) is a slightly sweet, light treat usually eaten as a dessert.
Denpun dango (でんぷん団子) from Hokkaido is made from potato flour and baked with sweet boiled beans.
Kuri dango (栗だんご) is coated in chestnut paste.
Niku dango (肉団子) is a type of Japanese meatball.[4] Chicken niku dango is called tsukune, served on a skewer.

A hairstyle consisting of dango-like buns on either side of the head is sometimes known as odango.
Dorodango is a Japanese art form in which earth and water are molded to create a delicate, shiny sphere, resembling a billiard ball.

In Vietnam[edit]
Bánh hòn is a specialty dessert of Phan Thiet. The cake is made from tapioca flour, coconut, roasted peanuts, salt and sugar. When finished, it is rolled over shredded coconut and skewered like Japanese dango.

 Inside of a dorayaki's cross-section
Dorayaki (どら焼き, どらやき, 銅鑼焼き, ドラ焼き) is a type of Japanese confection. It consists of two small pancake-like patties made from castella wrapped around a filling of sweet azuki bean paste.[1][2]
The original dorayaki consisted of only one layer. Its current shape was invented in 1914 by Usagiya in the Ueno district of Tokyo.[3]
In Japanese, dora means ""gong"", and because of the similarity of the shapes, this is probably the origin of the name of the sweet.[2][3] Legend has it that the first dorayaki were made when a samurai named Benkei forgot his gong (dora) upon leaving a farmer's home where he was hiding, and the farmer subsequently used the gong to fry the pancakes.[3]

Regional variation[edit]
In the Kansai area, this sweet is often called mikasa (三笠). The word originally means triple straw hat, but is also an alternative name of Mount Wakakusa, a low hill with gentle slopes located in Nara. In Nara, a larger mikasa of about 30 cm in diameter is made.[4]

In popular culture[edit]
The Japanese manga and anime character Doraemon loves dorayaki and so it is depicted as his favourite food (in the English dub, Nobita (Noby) calls it ""yummy buns"" as an alternative), and it has been a plot device several times throughout the series. Doraemon is addicted to dorayaki and falls for any trap involving them. Since 2000, the company Bunmeido has been selling a limited version of dorayaki called Doraemon Dorayaki every year around March and September. Since 2015, JFC International has produced Doraemon Dorayaki for the North American market.
In 2015 filmmaker Naomi Kawase released the film ""An"" (""Sweet Bean""), based on a novel by Durian Sukegawa, about an elderly woman who has a secret recipe for truly transcendent dorayaki anko.[5][6][7]

GionbōTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsGyūhi, bean jam, sugar
Gionbō (祇園坊 or ぎおんぼう) is a wagashi (Japanese sweet). It resembles a dried persimmon, and is now made by filling gyūhi (a soft form of mochi) with bean jam, then sprinkling white sugar over it.
In the time when sugar was an expensive rarity, dried persimmon, made by drying astringent persimmons (Japanese: shibugaki), was a precious sweetener, and it was very commonly used in many households. At that time, wagashi was made to showcase this fine fruit, and since then it has become one of the most familiar wagashi in Japan.

GyūhiOrange gyuhi (left) and suama (right)TypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsGlutinous rice or mochiko
Gyūhi (求肥) is a form of wagashi (traditional Japanese sweet). Gyūhi is a softer variety of mochi (餅), and both are made from either glutinous rice or from mochiko (餅粉, glutinous rice flour).
Because gyūhi is more delicate, it is usually less frequently made and served than mochi. It is sometimes featured in sweets that originated in the Kyoto area. Tinted gyūhi is the base of matsunoyuki, a wagashi that resembles a pine tree dusted with snow.
Gyūhi is also used as an ingredient in other wagashi such as Nerikiri [ja], which is made of a blend of gyūhi and Shiroan [ja], a white bean-based version of anko. Nerikiri is often tinted and molded in ways similar to the treatment of marzipan in Western desserts.

Hyōroku mochi[edit]
Hyōroku mochi is a type of candy which is made and sold by Seika Foods [ja] in Kagoshima.  This is made of gyūhi.

Hanabiramochi

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to search
HanabiramochiTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsMochi, miso, Gyūhi, burdock
Hanabiramochi (葩餅) is a Japanese sweet (wagashi), usually eaten at the beginning of the year.[1] Hanabiramochi are also served at the first tea ceremony of the new year.[2]

Contents

1 Origin
2 Form
3 Significance and symbolism
4 See also
5 References


Origin[edit]
The name ""hanabiramochi"" literally means ""flower petal mochi"". The original form of Hanabiramochi is Hishihanabira, a dessert that was eaten by the Imperial family at special events coinciding with the beginning of the year.
Hanabiramochi was first made in the Meiji Era (8 September 1868 – 30 July 1912), but it is now a familiar New Year wagashi.

Form[edit]
The exact shape of hanabiramochi is strictly defined by tradition. The white mochi covering is flat and round, folded over to form a semicircular shape, and must have a pink color showing through in the center of the confection, fading to a white at the edge. Unlike a daifuku, the mochi must not completely seal the insides.
In the center of a hanabiramochi is a layer of anko, a sweet bean paste, commonly the white kind made from sweetened mung beans.  In the very center is a thin strip of sweetly flavoured gobo (burdock), which protrudes from the mochi on both sides.

Significance and symbolism[edit]
Each element of the hanabiramochi is significant:
The red colour showing through the white mochi is not only appropriate to the celebration of the new year, but also evokes the Japanese apricot/plum (ume) blossom, which in turn represents the purity, perseverance, and renewal associated with the New Year.
The gobo represents pressed ayu, a fish exclusive to East Asia, and a prayer for a long life.

Higashi (干菓子・乾菓子, lit. 'dry confectionery'), is a type of wagashi containing very little moisture, and thus keeps relatively longer than other kinds of wagashi.

Overview[edit]
Higashi, in contrast to namagashi, are a category of wagashi with any type of dry consistency. This can include rakugan, konpeitō (a type of hard candy), senbei (a type of rice cracker), arare (another type of rice cracker), and so on, though rice crackers are typically savoury, and thus not considered wagashi. Sweet higashi are roughly equivalent to Western cookies or biscuits.
A narrower definition of higashi may confine the recipe to one or more kinds of sugar, with a particular sort of flour, and some other additives, while there are some higashi made solely of sugar, with no flour content.
The flour used in higashi is usually made of rice, which has many different varieties of its own. Flours made of other ingredients, like azuki, soybean or green pea and starches are often used too.
Higashi made with wasanbon, Japanese premium traditionally-made fine-grained sugar, are commonly regarded as the finest higashi. The most common and well-known higashi is rakugan, but the definition of the word[clarification needed] is somewhat vague and sometimes not suitable for a certain type of wagashi, so the word higashi would be better in some cases.
Higashi are often served at Japanese tea ceremonies.

List of higashi[edit]
Goshikiitō (五色糖) – Five flavors: bainiku (pickled plum), hakka (Japanese mint), nikkei (cinnamon), shōga (ginger), and yuzu (citron), each with distinct shapes.
Hakusansekkei (白山雪渓)
Hanakazura (花かずら)
Mugirakushizuka (麦らく静)
Nininsuzuka (二人静)
Rakugan (落雁)
Shigure no matsu (時雨の松)
Suiko (推古) – Aka (pinkish red) and shiro (white) are available.

Diamond shaped mochi that consists of three layers
Hishi mochiTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsMochi, fruit of Gardenia jasminoides, water caltrop, Gnaphalium affineHishi mochi (菱餅, ひしもち) is a symbolic Japanese sweet associated with the Hinamatsuri ""Girl's Day"" festival, which coincides with the calendar date for Xiuxi (上巳). The sweet is diamond shapes and typically formed from three layers of red (pink), white, and green mochi, from top to bottom.[1][2] Depending on region, yellow may be substituted for red, or the sweet may have 5 or 7 layers instead. It is usually presented with hina dolls.
The shape is believed to have originated in the Edo period, and to be a representation of fertility.

Colors[edit]
The red of the mochi are derived from fruits of Gardenia jasminoides (山梔子), and is symbolic of peach flowers. The white is made from the water caltrop (菱, hishi), and represents the snow and its cleansing effects. Finally, the green is from Gnaphalium affine (ハハコグサ) or mugwort[3] like kusa mochi, and is believed to be a restorative that improves the blood.[1]

Japanese and Taiwanese dessert
ImagawayakiCourseSnackPlace of originJapanRegion or stateJapan, Taiwan, South KoreaServing temperatureHotMain ingredientsBatter, sweet azuki bean paste  Media: Imagawayaki
Imagawayaki (今川焼き) is a Japanese dessert often found at Japanese festivals as well as outside Japan, in countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. It is made of batter in a special pan (similar to a waffle iron but without the honeycomb pattern), and filled with sweet azuki bean paste, although it is becoming increasingly popular to use a wider variety of fillings such as vanilla custard, different fruit custards and preserves, curry, different meat and vegetable fillings, potato and mayonnaise.[1][2] Imagawayaki are similar to dorayaki, but the latter are two separate pancakes sandwiched around the filling after cooking, and are often served cold.
Imagawayaki were first sold near the Kanda's Imagawabashi Bridge during the An'ei era (1772–1781) of the Edo period (1603–1867). The name imagawayaki originates from this time.

By store or company[edit]
Gozasōrō (御座候) – product name for imagawayaki produced by Gozasōrō Inc, established in 1950 in Himeji. It means ""thank you for the purchase"" in an archaic style.[3]
Higiri-yaki (ひぎりやき) – product name for imagawayakiproduced by Sawai Honpo Inc in Ehime. It originates in Higiri jizō near the Matsuyama Station.[4]
Jiman'yaki (自慢焼き) – product name for imagawayaki used by the Fuji Ice shop in Nagano.

Fukkō-yaki (復興焼き, ""revival yaki"") – in the song on the occasion of the revival after the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, is mentioned that imagawayaki was renamed fukkōyaki.[5]
Taiwan[edit]
Imagawayaki were introduced to Taiwan during the period of Japanese rule in Taiwan and are now a traditional snack in Taiwan. They are commonly called ""red bean (i.e. azuki) cakes"" (Chinese: 紅豆餅; pinyin: hóngdòu bǐng). However, some of the older generation may directly use the Japanese term taiko manjū (太鼓饅頭), and in the greater Taipei area, they are also referred to as ""wheel cakes"" (Chinese: 車輪餅; pinyin: chēlún bǐng).

South Korea[edit]
Imagawayaki are known as 오방떡 (obang tteok) or 홍두병 (紅豆餅/hongdu byeong) in South Korea.

Malaysia[edit]
Imagawayaki are known as tokiwado in Malaysia.

Philippines[edit]
The Filipino counterpart, locally known as ""Japanese cakes"", are similar to imagawayaki but of a smaller serving size and are usually filled with cheese slices. This inexpensive snack is commonly found sold on special tricycle carts that have a built-in custom-made circular cooking mold. Other fillings are also available with sweet (strawberry, chocolate) and savory (ham and cheese) fillings.[6]

KarintōTypeSnack foodPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsFlour, yeast, and brown sugar  Media: Karintō
Karintō (花林糖, karintō, (ateji)) is a traditional Japanese snack food. Sweet and deep-fried, it is made primarily of flour, yeast, and brown sugar. It has a deep brown and pitted appearance, and takes the form of a bite-sized pillow or short cylinder. Although traditional karintō is coated with brown sugar, recently other variations appear in the market, such as white sugar, sesame seeds, miso, or peanuts.

In popular culture[edit]
In Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice, police detective and forensic scientist Ema Skye constantly eats karintō on duty (the snack was localized as chocolate-flavored ""snackoos"").
In Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, karintō is stated to be one of Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu's favourite foods.
In Gosick, Kujo gives karintō to Victorique, who comments that they look like dog feces.
In Lycoris Recoil, karintō are a staple food at the dorm.
History[edit]
Karintō's roots are unclear, with primary origination theories being either from around the Nara Period or being derived from a Portuguese snack in a later period.  In either case it has been available from street merchants since at least the Tenpō era, roughly from 1830 to 1841.

Konpeitō (金平糖, こんぺいとう), also spelled kompeitō, is a type of Japanese sugar candy. It takes the form of a small sphere with a bumpy surface, and comes in a variety of colors and flavors.[1]

Etymology[edit]
The word konpeitō comes from the Portuguese word confeito (comfit), which is a type of sugar candy.[2]
The characters 金平糖 (lit. ""golden flat sugar"") are ateji selected mostly for their phonetic value and can also be written 金米糖 or 金餅糖.

History[edit]
The technique for producing sugar candy was introduced to Japan in the early 16th century by Portuguese traders. The infrastructure and refining technology of sugar had not yet been established in Japan. As konpeitō uses a lot of sugar, it was very rare and expensive as a result. In 1569, Luís Fróis, a Portuguese missionary, presented a glass flask of konpeitō to Oda Nobunaga in order to obtain the permit for mission work of Christianity.[3][4]
By the Meiji period, konpeitō had already been culturally prescribed as one of the standards of Japanese sweets—the character Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker was translated into Konpeitō no Sei (金平糖の精, ""Fairy of Konpeitō"").[5]

Production[edit]
Konpeitō is usually 5 to 10 mm (0.20 to 0.39 in) in diameter and is produced by repeatedly coating a sugar syrup over a core consisting of a grain of coarse sugar. Originally, the core was a poppy seed. The process is somewhat similar to the dragée process, except the candies are produced by being ladled with sugar syrup and rotated slowly in a large heated gong-shaped tub (dora). Each grain of the core sugar grows over the course of several days with the continued rotating, heating, and application of syrup, becoming a ball covered with tiny bulges. It usually takes 7–13 days to make konpeitō and they are still crafted by artisans today.[6]

Other uses[edit]
 Konpeitō
The Japanese Ministry of Defense's Emergency Food Ration tins and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's Combat Ration tins both contain konpeito candies, in addition to hard tack bread/biscuits and other food items. While the candies aid in the calorie content necessary for activities, it also helps promote the creation of saliva to make it easier to eat the dry bread. According to the Ministry of Defense's specifications, ""Each white emergency ration bag will contain 150g of small dry bread, with 8 whites, 3 reds, 2 yellows, 2 greens as standard, amounting to 15g or more to be put in the bag.” It is thought that providing the 'colorful and enjoyable' Konpeito will also reduce the stress that would be experienced at times during a disaster.[7]
Konpeito is often used for celebrations such as marriage and childbirth, in elaborate candy boxes called bonbonniere (ボンボニエール), from the French bonbonnière, meaning candy box.[8] It is given as a gift for prayers at shrines and temples. The practice of giving bonbonniere dates back to the commemoration ceremony of the Meiji Constitution in 1889 and has since been thought to be a symbol of good luck. The Japanese Imperial Family has used these Onshino Konpeitō as the official ‘Welcome’ gift continuously for over 130 years.[9][10][11]

In popular culture[edit]
The Star Bits in Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel,[12] the Gratitude Crystals and Star Fragments in The Legend of Zelda series, the Star Fragments in Animal Crossing[13] as well as Minior, Max Revives (and to a lesser extent, Revives), Cosmog's star candies from the Pokémon series, and EXP Star Jellies in Cookie Run: Kingdom are all based on these candies.[citation needed] The susuwatari from Studio Ghibli films such as Spirited Away are also shown to eat konpeitō. Super Mario RPG also features it as an attack item that was localized as ""Rock Candy"".[14] The candies also featured in an episode of the children's anime Hamtaro, referred to as ""diamonds of sugar"" in the English dub.

KuzumochiTypeCakePlace of originJapanServing temperatureColdMain ingredientsMochi, kuzuko
 Tokyo-style kuzumochi (久寿餅)
Kuzumochi (葛餅/久寿餅) is a Japanese term referring either to mochi cakes made of kuzuko (葛餅) or mochi cakes made from Lactobacillales-fermented wheat starch (久寿餅), a speciality dish local to certain wards of Tokyo, served chilled and topped with kuromitsu and kinako.
Add water and sugar to kuzu powder and cook it over a slow flame, stirring continuously till it thickens and becomes transparent. It also becomes elastic to the touch. The transparent appearance gives a cool impression, so it is often eaten especially in summer.

ManjūTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanRegion or stateEast AsiaMain ingredientsFlour, rice powder, buckwheat, red bean paste  Media: Manjū
Manjū (饅頭, まんじゅう) is a traditional Japanese confection. Of the many varieties of manjū, most have an outside made from flour, rice powder, kudzu, and buckwheat, and a filling of anko (red bean paste), usually made from boiled adzuki beans and sugar. Manjū is sometimes made with other fillings such as chestnut jam. In Hawaii, one can find Okinawan manjū that are made with a filling of purple sweet potato, butter, milk, sugar, and salt, but the most common filling is bean paste, of which the several varieties include koshian, tsubuan, and tsubushian.

History[edit]
Manju is a traditional Japanese flour-based pastry (instead of rice-based like mochi). It originated in China under the name  mantou in Chinese, but became known as manjū when it came to Japan. In 1341, a Japanese envoy who came back from China brought back mantou with him and started to sell it as nara-manjū. This was said to be the origin of Japanese manjū. Since then, it has been eaten for nearly 700 years by Japanese people. Now it can be found in many Japanese sweet shops. Its low price is a reason that it is popular.

Varieties[edit]
 Mizu manjū (水饅頭)
 Usukawa manjū (薄皮饅頭)
Of the myriad varieties of manjū, some more common than others.

Matcha (green tea) manjū is one of the most common. In this case, the outside of the manjū has a green tea flavor and is colored green.
Mizu (water) manjū is traditionally eaten in the summertime and contains a flavored bean filling. The exterior of the mizu manjū is made with kuzu starch, which gives the dough a translucent, jelly-like appearance.[1]
Also, manjū can have different flavored fillings, such as orange-flavored cream.
As is the case with many Japanese foods, in some parts of Japan, one can find manjū unique to that region, such as the maple leaf-shaped momiji manjū in Hiroshima and Miyajima.
The regional variety of the Saitama prefecture is called Jumangoku manjū.

Japanese starch-based sweetener
MizuameTypeSweetenerPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsGlutinous rice and malt or potatoes  Media: Mizuame
Mizuame (水飴, literally ""water candy"", also known as millet jelly) is a sweetener from Japan. A clear, thick, sticky liquid, it is made by converting starch to sugars. Mizuame is added to wagashi to give them a sheen, eaten in ways similar to honey, and can be a main ingredient in sweets. Some Mizuame are produced in a very similar fashion to corn syrup and are very similar in taste.
Two methods are used to convert the starches to sugars. The traditional method is to take glutinous rice mixed with malt, and let the natural enzymatic process take place, converting the starch to syrup[1] which consists mainly of maltose.[2] The second and more common method is acid hydrolysis of potato starch or sweet potato starch by adding acid, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acids,[1] to make glucose syrup. If done by the first method, the final product, known as mugi mizuame (麦水飴), is considered more flavorful than the acid version.[1]

Japanese confection
MonakaTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsMochi, azuki bean paste  Media: Monaka
Monaka (最中) is a Japanese sweet made of azuki bean paste sandwiched between two thin crisp wafers made from mochi. The wafers can have the shape of a square, a triangle, or may be shaped like cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, and so on.
The azuki bean paste filling in monaka can contain sesame seeds, chestnuts,[1] or rice cake (mochi). Modern monaka can have an ice cream filling instead of azuki bean paste. Choco Monaka Jumbo is an ice cream product made with an ice cream and chocolate filling inside the traditional mochi wafers.[2] It was created in 1972 and is produced by Morinaga.[3]
Monaka is a type of dessert (wagashi) which is served with tea. There are still many very famous monaka specialty stores in Japan.

Namagashi (生菓子) are a type of wagashi, which is a general term for traditional Japanese sweets and candies.[3] Namagashi may contain fruit jellies, other gelatines such as Kanten, or sweetened bean paste.[4][3]  Namagashi is detailed, designed with using seasonal and natural motifs such as leaves and flowers to reflect the various objects of nature in Japan's four seasons.[5] Namagashi are usually freshly made and are much more moist than other wagashi, like higashi.[4][3] It generally contains 30% more water than other types. Like other wagashi, namagashi are made of natural ingredients; additives are rarely used. Namagashi is generally served with tea, and it's traditionally eaten on New Year's for good luck.[2]

Sakuramochi (桜餅) is a Japanese confection (wagashi) consisting of sweet, pink-colored rice cake (mochi) with a red bean paste (anko) center and wrapped in a pickled cherry blossom (sakura) leaf. Different regions of Japan have different styles of sakuramochi. Kanto-style uses shiratama-ko (白玉粉, rice flour) to make the rice cake, and Kansai-style uses dōmyōji-ko (道明寺粉, glutinous rice flour). The sweet is traditionally eaten during the spring season, especially on Girl's Day (hinamatsuri; March 3) and at flower viewing parties (hanami).[1]

SenbeiStandard senbei and a cross section viewAlternative namesSembeiTypeRice crackerPlace of originJapanRegion or stateEast AsiaMain ingredientsJapanese rice (uruchimai)  Media: Senbei
Senbei (煎餅, alternatively spelled sembei) are a type of Japanese rice cracker.[1] They come in various shapes, sizes, and flavors, usually savory but sometimes sweet. Senbei are often eaten with green tea as a casual snack and offered to visiting house guests as a courtesy refreshment.
There are several types of traditional Japanese senbei. They can be baked or deep-fried and sometimes sweetened. Aside from rice, wheat flour or starch can be used. Some varieties even use foods other than grains, such as sakana senbei (fish-senbei), renkon senbei (lotus root senbei) and hone senbei (bone-senbei).
Senbei have several variations, including Nori-wrapped, Arare, Olive no Hana, Soy nut, and wet. Thin rice crackers (薄焼きせんべい usuyaki senbei) are popular in Australia and other countries.[2]
In China, the same characters used to write senbei are read jiānbǐng (煎饼; 煎餅; jiānbǐng); the term instead refers to a crepe and is more similar in preparation to okonomiyaki among Japanese foods. In Japan, senbei are hard and crispy, and are bite-sized snacks rather than street-food meals. However, crackers similar to Japanese senbei can be found in China today and their modern Chinese name is 仙贝; 仙貝; xiānbèi, which reflects the Japanese-language pronunciation of ""senbei"" (煎餅).

Preparation[edit]
 Senbei being grilled
Senbei are made from glutinous rice which has been steamed for 15 to 20 minutes before being pounded into dough. After several days of refrigeration, the dough is cut into shapes.[3]
Senbei are usually cooked by being baked or grilled, traditionally over charcoal. While being prepared they may be brushed with a flavoring sauce, often one made of soy sauce and mirin. They may then be wrapped with a layer of nori. Alternatively they may be flavored with salt or ""salad"" flavoring, among others.

History[edit]
Sweet senbei (甘味煎餅) came to Japan during the Tang dynasty, with the first recorded usage in 737 AD, and still are very similar to Tang traditional styles, originally often baked in the Kansai area, of which include the traditional ""roof tile"" senbei. These include ingredients like potato and wheat flour or glutinous rice, and are similar to castella cakes, distinctly different from what most people would consider as senbei today, though traditional senbei such as this can still be found, e.g. Iga meibutsu katayaki, in Iga City.
What Japanese commonly refer to as senbei nowadays were popularized by a teahouse in Sōka city in the Edo period, which spread salty soy sauce flavored senbei throughout Japan.
Modern senbei versions are very inventive and may include flavorings which can range from kimchi to wasabi to curry to chocolate.
Kansai senbei tend to use glutinous rice and are lightly seasoned and delicate in texture (saku saku). Kantō senbei were originally based on uruchimai, a non-glutinous rice, and they tend to be more crunchy (kari kari) and richly flavored.

TaiyakiTwo taiyaki.CourseSnackPlace of origin JapanRegion or stateJapanese-speaking areasMain ingredientsBatter, sweetened adzuki beans Cookbook: Taiyaki  Media: Taiyaki
Taiyaki (鯛焼き, lit. 'baked sea bream') is a Japanese fish-shaped cake, commonly sold as street food. It imitates the shape of tai (鯛, red sea bream), which it is named after. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened adzuki beans.  Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside. Smaller, differently shaped versions called kingyoyaki (金魚焼き, lit. 'baked goldfish') are also available and often sold in bags of five, ten, or more.
Taiyaki are similar to imagawayaki, which are thick round cakes also filled with sweet adzuki bean paste or custard.

Ingredients[edit]
 Taiyaki being made on a griddle with fish-shaped molds
Taiyaki is made using regular pancake or waffle batter. The batter is poured into a fish-shaped mold for each side. The filling is then put on one side and the mold is closed. It is then cooked on both sides until golden brown.

History[edit]
 Storefront of Naniwaya Sōhonten (浪花家総本店), where taiyaki was invented
Taiyaki was first sold in Japan in 1909. It is essentially a reshaped form of imagawayaki, an already popular snack made by wrapping bean paste in flour skin.
Seijirō Kobe, founder of the store Naniwaya Sōhonten (浪花家総本店), was having trouble selling his imagawayaki, so he decided to bake the cakes into fish shapes resembling tai, or red sea bream. Tai are considered a symbol of luck and fortune in Japan, and were an expensive fish only affordable by the higher classes or on special occasions. Masamori Kobe, the fourth owner of the store, stated that Seijirō wanted to give the ordinary people a taste of the expensive fish at low prices.
Since its creation, taiyaki has evolved into many variations, with different ingredients being used for filling and batter, as well as variations in shapes and sizes.
Taiyaki was introduced to Korea during the Japanese colonial period, where it is known as bungeo-ppang.
During the postwar period, taiyaki spread to other Asian countries, as well as to the United States.

Tokoroten

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to search
TokorotenTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsseaweed (tengusa, ogonori)  Media: Tokoroten
Tokoroten (心太, ところてん) is a dish in Japanese cuisine made from agarophytes. Tokoroten has been eaten by the Japanese for over a thousand years.[1] Tokoroten is thought to have been introduced to Japan from China during the Nara period.[2] Tokoroten was traditionally made by boiling tengusa (Gelidium amansii) and then allowing the mixture to congeal into a jelly.[1]
Tokoroten was a popular snack during the summertime in Edo (Tokyo) during the Edo period.[2]  It was originally made to be eaten immediately and was commonly sold around factories.[3]  In the 17th century, it was discovered that freezing tokoroten would result in a stable and dry product known as kanten (agar).[3][1] While tokoroten can be made from kanten based on seaweeds such as tengusa (Gelidiaceae) and ogonori (Gracilaria), today commercially produced kanten is mostly made from ogonori.[2]
Pressed against a device, the jelly is shaped into noodles. Unlike gelatin desserts, tokoroten has a firmer texture.
Tokoroten was and can be eaten hot (in solution) or cold (as a gel).[3] Flavorings and garnishes can vary from region to region. Today, it is the most common to eat tokoroten with a mixture of vinegar and soy sauce,[4] and sometimes nori,[5] hot pepper, or sesame. In Kansai region, tokoroten is eaten as a dessert with kuromitsu.[6]

Japanese steamed cake
UirōUirō of sakura (left), ryokucha (centre), shiro (right)TypeCakePlace of originJapanMain ingredientsRice flour, sugar  Media: Uirō
Uirō (Japanese: 外郎, 外良, ういろう), also known as uirō-mochi (外郎餠), is a traditional Japanese steamed cake made of glutinous rice flour and sugar.[1] It is chewy, similar to mochi, and subtly sweet. Flavors include azuki bean paste, green tea (matcha), yuzu, strawberry and chestnut. Nagoya is particularly famous for its uirō, and there are other regional versions, notably in Yamaguchi and Odawara, although Odawara's uirō is better known as a medicine. It can be purchased in traditional Japanese confectionery shops throughout Japan.[1]
Uirō was originally the name of a medicine in the Muromachi period (1336–1573). References to uirō as a confection first appear in the Wa-Kan Sansai Zue, Ryōan Terajima's massive Edo-period dictionary published in 1712.[2]

WarabimochiTypeWagashiCoursesnack/dessertPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsBracken starch, kinakoVariationssesame  Media: Warabimochi
Warabimochi (蕨餅, warabi-mochi) is a wagashi (Japanese confection) made from warabiko (bracken starch) and covered or dipped in kinako (sweet toasted soybean flour).[1][2][3] It differs from true mochi made from glutinous rice.[2] It is popular in the summertime, especially in the Kansai region and Okinawa, and often sold from trucks, similar to an ice cream truck in Western countries.[3]
Warabimochi was one of the favorite treats of Emperor Daigo.[3]
Today, warabimochi is frequently made with katakuriko (potato starch) instead of bracken starch due to cost and availability.[4][5] Kuromitsu syrup is sometimes poured on top before serving as an added sweetener.[6]

Main ingredientsSugarcane plants (taketō or chikusha)
Wasanbon (和三盆) is a fine-grained Japanese sugar, traditionally made in the Shikoku prefectures of Tokushima and Kagawa, centered to the towns of Kamiita-cho and Donari-cho in Tokushima, where it has been made since about the 1770s. The sugar is often used for Japanese sweets (wagashi). The sugar is made from thin sugarcane plants (Saccharum sinense) grown locally in Shikoku, called taketō (竹糖) or chikusha (竹蔗) (locally known as hosokiki).

Use[edit]
It is a light golden colour, with granules slightly larger than icing sugar, and has a unique aroma and flavour, with butter and honey overtones. Wasanbon is used in making sweets and yōkan, as a coffee and tea sweetener, in dipping sauces at sushi restaurants, and in baking at home.
A grade of the sugar called ""awa wasanbon toh"" is considered by some people to be the highest grade.

Production[edit]
The traditional manufacturing process of wasanbon involves 8 stages, and takes roughly 20 days as a whole. The sugarcane is harvested between December and February. It is harvested late in the year on purpose, to allow the sugar content of the cane to develop to its maximum, as the variety of sugarcane used produces less sugar than other varieties used elsewhere in the world.
The cane is pressed by machine to extract its juice. The juice goes into a tank; the crushed canes are used as cattle fodder, or fertilizer. The juice is then brought to a boil and boiled for about 30 minutes, producing a green foam, which is removed, as it contains a bitter green lye.
At the end of this process, the juice is a light yellow coloured, and is allowed to stand to allow sediment to settle to the bottom. The clarified juice is drained off, then boiled again to condense it, then cooled. The juice develops a light brown colour. It is allowed to stand for one week, during which time it mostly solidifies into crystalline masses. These solids are wrapped in a cloth and squeezed in a pressing tub for a day to press liquid out of those solidified pieces.
The pieces are then washed and kneaded with water 4 or 5 times, to refine the sugar in them and make it whiter.[1]
The pieces are then dried quickly so that the sugar does not ferment, and then crushed and sieved into a fine sugar.

YatsuhashiRaw, cinnamon-flavoured yatsuhashiTypeWagashi (miyagegashi)Place of originJapanRegion or stateKyotoMain ingredientsGlutinous rice flour, sugar, cinnamon  Media: Yatsuhashi
 Assorted nama yatsuhashi. Flavors, from top to bottom: tofu, cinnamon, sesame.
Yatsuhashi (八ツ橋 or 八橋) is a Japanese confection sold mainly as a souvenir snack (miyagegashi). It is one of the best known meibutsu (famous regional products) of Kyoto. It is made from glutinous rice flour (上新粉, jōshinko), sugar, and cinnamon. Baked, it is similar to senbei. The shape of the hard crackers resembles a Japanese harp or koto, or a bamboo stalk cut lengthways. 
Raw, unbaked yatsuhashi (Nama yatsuhashi) has a soft, mochi-like texture and is often eaten wrapped around red bean paste (餡, an). The unbaked yatsuhashi (Nama yatsuhashi) is cut into a square shape after being rolled very thin, and folded in half diagonally to make a triangle shape, with the red bean paste inside. Unbaked yatsuhashi may also come in a variety of different flavours.[1] Popular flavours include cinnamon and matcha. Yatsutashi is also rolled into a rectangular shape and steamed.

YōkanTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsAgar, sugar, red bean paste or white kidney bean paste  Media: Yōkan
 Cubes of green tea yōkan
Yōkan (羊羹) is a wagashi (Japanese confection) made of red bean paste, agar, and sugar. It is usually sold in a block form, and eaten in slices.  There are two main types: neri yōkan and mizu yōkan. ""Mizu"" means ""water"", and indicates that it is made with more water than usual. Mizu yōkan is often chilled and eaten in the summer.

Types[edit]
Although yōkan found in Japan and abroad is typically made with red bean paste, yōkan made from white kidney bean paste (しろあん, 白餡, shiro an) is also relatively common. This type of yōkan is milky and translucent with a much milder flavour than that made of red bean paste. As such, it can be effectively flavoured and coloured by using green tea powder.
Yōkan may also contain chopped chestnuts,[1] persimmons, whole sweetened azuki beans, figs, and sweet potato (imo yōkan), among other additions. Sugar can also be replaced with honey, dark brown sugar, or molasses to alter the taste of the yōkan produced. There is also shio yōkan, which uses small amounts of salt.

History[edit]
Originally a Chinese jelly from the gelatin derived from boiling sheep, the term ""yōkan"" literally means “sheep geng” (羊 sheep + 羹 thick soup).
It was introduced to Japan by Zen Buddhists in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, around 1191. As Buddhism forbids killing, they replaced the animal gelatin with wheat flour and azuki beans. Agar came into use after it was discovered around 1658, in Japan. This variation became the basis of modern yōkan.[2]
One of the most popular Japanese sweets, it evolved further during the Edo period as sugar became more available. It can be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration unless opened, and is a staple gift item.

Yubeshi

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
YubeshiTypeWagashiPlace of originJapanMain ingredientsSticky rice or rice flour, sugar and soy sauce; Walnuts or Japanese citrus (usually yuzu)
Yubeshi (Japanese: ゆべし) is a type of wagashi (Japanese confection). It has several flavor and shape variations, most commonly walnuts or Japanese citrus (usually yuzu), and can be round or square, but all yubeshi has a base of sticky rice or rice flour, sugar and soy sauce. The process of production is very labor-intensive.[1] A circle is cut out of the top of the yuzu and set aside. A wooden spatula removes the fruit and scrapes away the white pith of the yuzu, leaving only the zest. The fruit is then stuffed with a filling which can range from plain mochiko flour to a traditional blend of mochiko, shōyu, and other spices. The reserved top of the fruit is placed back in as a cap, and the whole thing is steamed repeatedly until the fruit is shiny and brown and the mochi has fully gelatinized. The longer the product is stored, the harder the texture will become. Both the rind and filling are edible. Yubeshi can be served in many ways, whether sliced thin on top of rice dishes and salad, or softened in a warm soup dish.[2]
